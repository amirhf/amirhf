Hi, I’m **Amir Firouzmanesh** — a senior software engineer (PhD) and founder of **AandZ.tech**, an independent AI & cloud engineering practice based in the UAE. I’ve shipped production systems at **Microsoft**, **Amazon Web Services**, **Property Finder**, and DataGardens: from AI-powered photo editing in Windows Photos, to RDS SQL Server features and marketplace analytics at AWS, to subscription/credit platforms behind real-estate listings.

These days I focus on **AI integration** (LLMs, RAG, agents, image models) and **event-driven architectures** (CQRS, outbox, idempotent consumers, Kafka/Redpanda, RabbitMQ). A lot of my thinking lives in open-source reference projects — like **Credit Ledger**, **AI Image Search / Feature Router**, and **Learning Path Designer** — which I use as blueprints for client work, interviews, and teaching.

#### What I’m working on

- 💡 **Reference systems** for credits/ledgers, AI image search, and RAG/agentic apps  
- 🧠 **Practical AI integration**: routing between local models and cloud LLMs, evaluation, and guardrails  
- 🧱 **Event-driven platforms**: CQRS, transactional outbox, replayable projections, and strong invariants  
- 🧭 **Architecture & mentoring**: helping teams clarify designs, ship reliably, and level up their engineering practice

#### Tools I like
